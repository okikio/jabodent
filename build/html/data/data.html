        description:
            "Safety management system manual (SMS) is an ofﬁcial document that depicts how a shipping company plans and implements policies to ensure safety of their ships and the marine environment. Safety management system is a vital part of the international safety management code as developed by the International Maritime Organization and it ensures that policies, practices and procedures are established and implemented for the safety of the ships at sea. The safety management system also ensures that ships comply with internationally accepted mandatory safety rules and regulation, codes, guidelines and international standard recommended by the various ﬂag administrations, classiﬁcation society and the international maritime organization. JOCL prepare the safety management system manual as per your organizations structure (whether small or big), train your employees how to implement procedure as per the manual, organize your system to operate effectively and efﬁciently.",

        description:
            "Condition survey is a stand-alone assessment of the physical and operating condition of Marine Facilities and equipment at that point in time to ascertain its suitability for speciﬁc work scope as required by the client. Facility/Equipment Condition & Value survey is mostly carried out for current owners or for intending charterer for insurance purposes (change of insurance company or risk assurance). This inspection is necessary for insurance companies to determine whether or not the vessel is in an acceptable risk considering the structural integrity, machineries, function ability and suitability for the intended purpose as the value of the facility/equipment is a function of the above, ensuring adequate knowledge of the market value and the cost of replacement. JOCL will serve you right in the survey of your marine facility and equipment against best standard and ensure the best value for the services.",

            "Purchasing a Marine facility is a very capital intensive venture and absolute care is necessary to ensure you get the value for your money’s worth. A condition and value survey (in this case pre-purchase survey) is possibly the most comprehensive and detailed type of survey and it's a prerequisite in the buying of marine oil and gas facilities as surveyors inspects facilities as per their Class notations, ages, maintenance history and compliance to various standard e.g. Classiﬁcation society, Flag administrations, USCG, API. These surveys are mostly conducted aﬂoat and on the dock as status reveals with an inclusion of sea trials. All ﬁndings during the survey are noted and clearly explained in the written survey report. An appraisal of the facilities/equipment fair market value in comparison to actual selling prices of comparable facilities/equipment is also included. These survey and value inspection could also be utilized for insurance and ﬁnancing purposes and JOCL survey reports are acceptable by all insurance companies. A Condition and Value Surveycan also be used for insurance and ﬁnancing purposes.",

        title: "ON AND OFF HIRE BUNKER/CONDITION SURVEYS",
        description:
            "Bunker on board ship for ships consumption or carried as cargo is an essential part of shipping and a vital part in charter party agreements as the custody of bunker fuel onboard a vessel is transferred from the Owner of the vessel to the Charterer of the vessel when the vessel's charter begins, the reverse is the case when the vessel is redelivered to the owner at the end of the charter. As bunker is often referred to as a consistent and expensive consumable in the operation of the vessel, an exact quantity onboard at the start of the charter and at the end of the charter needs to be established to avoid dispute. Depending on the charter party agreement between the owners and the charterer, the quantity of all liquid consumables which includes but not limited to the below are recorded and reported on during on hire survey; FO (Fuel Oil), DO (Diesel Oil), LO (Lubricating Oil), MFO (Marine Fuel Oil), MGO (Marine Gas Oil), MO (Marine Diesel Oil), IFO (Intermediate Fuel Oil), HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil. Same will be surveyed during off hire in other to ascertain any difference in bunker quantity as any excess between the OFF hire quantity and the ON hire quantity is payable by the vessel Owner to the vessel Charterer and any shortage of same is payable by the vessels Charterer to the vessels Owner. A bunker Surveyor is often employed to sound the tanks independently with well calibrated measuring tools against the approved tank calibration referencing the actual tank height with consideration to the vessels trim and listing conditions, physically check each tanks temperature and bunker viscosity and carefully apply the correction factors when calculating the quantity. On hire and off hire survey is not only limited to the bunker, it is also required that the charterer redelivers the vessel in good working condition as delivered by the owner, normal wear and tear excepted. It is very important for a charterer to limit their liability by ensuring that all important information concerning the vessels condition is surveyed and reported on by an independent surveyor acting on behalf of the charterer or owner and ﬁnal report utilized as an evidence for their liability during the charter period, this is where JOCL comes in to proffer an independent and unbiased bunker/condition survey solution that ensures that both parties (owners and charterer) ends the venture with assurance of an unprejudiced deal.",

            "As implied, Draft Surveys are mostly performed for shippers, receivers, ship owners and ship charterer as well as offshore and shore terminals with the intention of ascertaining the amount of cargo loaded or discharged from a vessel. Draft survey governs accurate measurement of the vessel's displacement before and after loading and the difference between these two displacements is the weight of cargo loaded or discharged. JOCL quality personnel meticulously conduct draft surveys that serves the purpose and beneﬁt of all parties involved.",

It is usually performed to assess the extent of damage for insurance claim or to identify the probability for continuous usage, subsequent to the evaluation of the damage, recommendations are presented and options For repairs (in-situ repairs whilst in operation or off hire repairs), guide as to the cost of repairs and evaluation of the cause of the damage. With our accumulated experience, most often time's damage surveys are required to be carried out on very short notice offshore or ashore to prevent further damage to the facility/equipment and lost time on charter, JOCL ensures that services for damage survey and oversee of the repair process are carried out as per standardized requirement and completed in a timely manner.",

Inclining experiment is performed on a ﬂoating facility e.g. ships, rigs and barges to determine its stability, light ship weight and coordinates of its center of gravity at new construction and after a major modiﬁcation of the asset. It is a process where the ﬂoating facility is deliberately listed by known weight to collate data for calculation of the metacentric height or center of gravity to provide a measure of ships static stability. It is a known fact that errors associated with this experiments can be overwhelming, however JOCL have developed enough capacity harnessed from years of experience in ship building and new construction to mitigate these errors and uncertainties and report on these experiments with consistent precision.",
